# MLR Documents | Emails

Path: Admin Space > Approved Email Builder

Overview
MLR reviews are a key practice in pharmaceutical marketing, ensuring that marketing and promotional materials comply with regulatory standards. The MLR process usually begins after the client approves the marketing creative work. A team of legal, medical, and regulatory experts carefully reviews each marketing component, assessing the accuracy of medical information, adherence to legal requirements, and compliance with ethical marketing practices.
Although the MLR process may vary slightly among pharmaceutical companies, the primary goal remains the same.
Key Functions
: In Shaman, you can create an MLR document either by exporting the current design directly to the vault from ShamanGo or by uploading a PDF. Additionally, you can retrieve MLR documents from PromoMats and attach them to the email during the Export step.

r, which means our integration is
built on validated API connections, follows Veeva development best practices, and is
supported by up-to-date product documentation and production customer references.
Page 4/22

As a Silver partner, our platform and integration workflows have been reviewed and
recognized by Veeva, ensuring a reliable and compliant connection between Shaman
and Veeva Vault PromoMats.
2. Shaman and Veeva Vault PromoMats
Together, Shaman and Veeva Vault PromoMats (VVPM) enable a compliant, scalable,
and fully integrated content production model. While Shaman provides an intuitive,
self-service authoring experience, Veeva Vault remains the single source of truth for all
commercial and medical content.
2.1 Authoring in Shaman, Managing in Vault
Shaman allows users to build composite assets from approved templates and
components—including those originating (stored) from PromoMats. Once a content
piece in Shaman is ready for review, users can seamlessly sync it into VVPM for
regulatory review.
This integration allows content teams to:
● Author faster and more autonomously
● Ensure that content entering VVPM is structured, complete, and traceable
● Maintain full control over compliance workflows through Vault
● No changes required to your MLR process and SOPs
2.2 Content Review and Approval
Once content is created in Veeva Vault as material, content owners can initiate and
manage the Medical, Legal, and Regulatory (MLR) review process in VVPM as usual.
Page 5/22

that content remains consistent across systems, aligns
with your SOPs, and respects Vault governance protocols — while unlocking a more
efficient and user-friendly content creation process.
Page 6/22

3. End-to-End Content workflow
To implement the Shaman–Veeva Vault integration, we begin with your existing SOPs
and content workflows as the foundation. Our goal is to extend, not replace, your
current processes — incorporating Shaman’s authoring capabilities in a way that aligns
with your governance and approval model.
Your current content workflow probably includes an external agency or internal
production team acting as content creator. Shaman can be introduced at this step,
replacing or augmenting that role with self-service content authoring.
While we follow your current workflow, Shaman often creates opportunities for
optimization — for example:
● Removing steps to manual upload content in Veeva Vault
● Removing the content html production step
● Approved content is pixel-perfect to html
● Auto review content
Throughout implementation, our team will proactively identify potential improvements,
such as reducing unnecessary steps or automating metadata handling. However, any
workflow changes are entirely up to your discretion and subject to your SOP
governance. Our guiding principle: respect your compliance model, enhance your
operational efficiency.
3.1 Your SOP/ End user Guide for Veeva Vault PromoMats
To ensure optimal configuration, we’d like to understand your current content production
process. This includes:
● Document types, subtypes, lifecycles and workflows
● Roles and responsibilities of users involved in content authoring, review, and
approval
● Lifecycle states and workflow steps used in VVPM to progress content

Title: Create an MLR Document in Shaman for an approved email

# Create an MLR Document in Shaman for an approved email

In this article:

How to create an MLR document in Shaman and sync your content to Veeva Vault?
Link to an existing MLR document in Veeva Vault
What is MLR document creation in Shaman?
MLR document creation for approved email in Shaman is designed to further simplify the process of creating multi-channel content for Veeva Vault.
An MLR document is a combination of a visual rendition of your email content, and the MLR proof you receive that approves the distribution of the email content you are creating for a specific amount of time and to a specific audience. Without an MLR document, it is not possible to approve content in Veeva Vault and make it available for your end users to users.
We understand that not all of the Shaman users in your organization will have access to Veeva Vault, so we have enabled a tool in Shaman that allows all users to create an MLR document in Shaman and sync their email fragments or templates directly to Veeva Vault (based on the email and your configuration).
The workflow outlined below means that Shaman users only need to contact their local Veeva Vault admin once in the process - to approve the MLR document for distribution and also approve the content (email fragments, email templates, or template fragments) in Veeva Vault.
In this article we will take you through step by step how to create an MLR document, and then sync your content to Veeva Vault.
How to create an MLR document in Shaman and sync your content to Veeva Vault?
Once you have completed the
Veeva settings
,
added copy
,
created a design
and
tested your email
, click on the tab “MLR” from the Overview page of your email fragment or template.
From here, you can export a PDF of your email fragment or email template to then send for review and approval in your FUSE or local approval system.
Export PDF options
Include responsive design (mobile view):
Enabling this option will include a rendition of the mobile version of your email design in the same PDF export as the desktop version.
Compare against previous PDF version:
Compare text of email versions in PDF export: If you have edited the text in your email and saved the versions separately (you can learn more about email versions
here
) you also have the option to compare the current version of your email, with any previous different version side by side in a PDF.
Include document information
Good to know!
If you are exporting an email template, you will see two additional options appear underneath the “PDF file” option: “Include selected email fragments” and “Include selected template fragment”.
You can click these toggles to enable them to show either email fragments or the selected template fragments in the exported PDF file.
Then, click the “Send to Email” button. You will receive the PDF file to your email address within a few minutes.
Good to know!
- A PDF file means you will receive a PDF of your email template or fragment.
- PDF file including related fragments means you will receive the email template and the email fragments used.
Top tip:

[2025-08-22] Liliana Ramos: Hi @Xavier Verbij happy Friday :partying_face:
We have a new-to-Shaman user in Takeda NL who can't initiate the MLR workflow in PromoMats. I believe this is because they don't have the right permissions.
If I got it right, once the MLR is in PromoMats, the user adds themselves as the owner and initiates the approval workflow, is this correct?
  → Xavier Verbij: Liliana, they will have to reach out to the Veeva Support team and ask the following things.

1. Add the "Shaman Co-Owner" role.
2. Enable the ability to view jobs for both CLMS and VAEs.
3. Add users to the group "Digital Specialist CMSO."
4. Update their security profile to "Digital Specialist."

​
How does the sync process from Shaman to Veeva Vault work?
From Shaman you can sync presentations directly to Veeva Vault, using the easy to use export option found through the “Export” tab. After the sync from Shaman, the presentation content will be ready for you to test in Veeva Vault.
Good to know!
Each time that you make changes to a presentation in Shaman, you will need to export the presentation again using the “Synchronise” button in the “Export" tab for the updates to show in Veeva Vault and your test CRM environment. In this article we will show you how to complete the sync (it is so easy!)
Syncing your presentation: from start to finish
Let's review the overall workflow for the creation, approval and upload of a presentation.
Good to know!
Create a presentation. Export a PDF of the final presentation.
Create a document in your local MLR approval system and upload the PDF of your presentation. Complete the review and approval process in your local MLR System.
Good to know!
It is now possible to create an MLR document for your CLM presentation in Shaman. Please contact your dedicated CSM to find out more.
Create an MLR document of the approved content in your Veeva Vault; upload the approved PDF and add metadata like expiry date and or local MLR System approval number.
Create a new presentation in Shaman. Upload the approved presentation in Shaman (accepted formats: PPT, PDF or a series of JPEGs or PNGs.
Assemble the slides, add supporting files like PDF documents and video and add an interactive layer of links.
In the Overview page of the presentation, complete the mandatory fields necessary for a successful sync to Veeva Vault.
If you have Slide naming configured in your account, review and add slide naming information for every slide through the “Slide details” tab.
If you have Shaman connect features enabled in your account, through the “Connect” tab, you can choose the Shaman connect settings for the presentation.
In the “Test” tab, preview the interactions, structure and navigation of the presentation.
In the “MLR” tab, select the MLR document you previously uploaded in Veeva Vault (link to existing), or if you have MLR creation for CLM enabled in your account, select “create new” to create a new MLR document.
In this tab, you can also export your presentation as a PDF handout, or as an web link to straight to your inbox.
Using the “Export” tab, click “Synchronise” to sync the CLM to Veeva Vault.
In Veeva Vault, set the binder, slides and shared resource file to “Staged”. Then, push the content to CRM Full (Menu: CRM publish).
You can now test the presentation in CRM Full using the relevant device (iOS, WinApp or Online).
When you have tested and everything in the presentation is working correctly, you can go back to Veeva Vault and change the status of the binder, slides and shared resource file to 'Approved'.
Publish the content to CRM Production (Menu: CRM publish)
Good to know!
If you take a look at the presentation in Shaman after following these steps, you will noticed that the fields relating to Veeva status and Veeva ID have been automatically populated.
Below we highlight the steps in Shaman related to this Veeva Vault Sync.
Create a new presentation in Shaman, check out
this article
if you need to review how to do this.
In the Overview page of the presentation, complete the mandatory fields necessary for a successful sync to Veeva Vault. You can review the product/brand before completing the sync to determine which users in Veeva CRM will have access to this presentation, as well as other important information.
Check out
this article
for more information on completing Veeva information for your presentation.
In the "Assemble" section, upload slides, add supporting files like PDF documents and video and add
an interactive layer of links.
If you have Slide naming configured in your account, review and add slide naming information for every slide through the “Slide details” tab. In slide naming, you can also assign names and categories to your slides by selecting “Settings” and then “Slide Naming”. (Check out
this article
for more information on completing slide naming for your presentation.)
If you have Shaman connect features enabled in your account, through the “Connect” tab, you can choose the Shaman connect settings for the presentation. Click
this article
to find out more.
In the “Test” tab, preview the interactions, structure and navigation of the presentation.
In the “MLR” tab, select the MLR document you previously uploaded in Veeva Vault (link to existing), or select “create new” to create a new MLR document.
Good to know!
MLR review is short for medical, legal, and regulatory affairs review. It's an essential process in healthcare marketing to make sure advertising and promotional content is accurate, compliant, and ready to be published.
The MLR process is how life sciences companies ensure the compliance of their marketing and promotion materials with internal and external regulations and brand guidelines.
When the MLR document of approved content is created in Veeva Vault, you can link it to your presentation in Shaman. Or alternatively, select “create new” to create a new MLR document.
To make sure you have the most up to date list of MLRs, double check first that the correct country and product/brand are selected for your presentation in the Veeva information page. You can then click Refresh to update the MLR documents available in Veeva Vault.
This list will fetch all MLR documents for the selected country and brand/ product. Select the related document, click Select, and then Done. Now the MLR document is selected and will be attached during sync.
Good to know!
Shaman will retrieve a list of MLR documents that relate to your corresponding product/brand.
This step is not mandatory, you can also add the MLR document later or add it to the presentation directly in Veeva Vault. Each Veeva Vault is configured differently, but usually you need to add an MLR document to your presentation before you can set the CLM to 'Staged' - which in turn you need to sync the presentation to CRM to test it.
In the MLR tab, you can also export your presentation as a PDF handout, or as a web link to straight to your inbox.
Using the “Export” tab, click “Synchronise” to sync the CLM to Veeva Vault.
When the MLR Document is selected, you will also be able to immediately set the presentation to “Set to Staged”, so that you can start testing it in Veeva CRM.
After syncing, go to Veeva Vault to push content to Veeva CRM for testin
g (Menu: CRM Publishing, select your CRM Org Full).
After the initial sync, you can make updates to the presentation and create a new version of the existing presentation in Veeva Vault. Just repeat this step. At update, Shaman will sync only the changes you made.
Good to know!
Any updates you make to your presentation will cause the content to revert back to “Staged” status in Veeva Vault, in which case you need to manually approve the content again for the changes to be visible in CRM Production/live.
In Veeva Vault, set the binder, slides and shared resource file to “Staged”. Then, push the content to CRM Full (Menu: CRM publish).
You can now test the presentation in CRM Full using the relevant device (iOS, WinApp or Online).
When you have tested and everything in the presentation is working correctly, you can go back to Veeva Vault and change the status of the binder, slides and shared resource file to 'Approved'.

# Feature 43

Feature Name: Feature 43

The VaultIntegrationUser feature enables seamless integration between Shaman's content authoring platform and Veeva Vault, allowing users to export content directly to Vault without needing to re-authenticate each time. This feature requires Integration Vault Key configuration and streamlines the workflow for pharmaceutical marketing teams, medical affairs professionals, and content managers who regularly publish approved materials like Closed Loop Marketing (CLM) presentations, Approved Email (AE) campaigns, and regulatory documents to Veeva Vault. System administrators and Veeva Vault administrators typically configure this integration to eliminate the friction of repeated login prompts during content publishing workflows. The feature is particularly valuable for organizations with high-volume content production where teams frequently move finalized pharmaceutical marketing materials, medical communications, and compliance-reviewed content from Shaman's authoring environment into Veeva's commercial content management system. Users searching for Veeva Vault connectivity, single sign-on integration, automated publishing workflows, or streamlined content deployment would benefit from this authentication-free export capability.

7. Configuring the Shaman accounts
To ensure a seamless user experience when interacting with Veeva Vault PromoMats
(VVPM), your organization's Shaman accounts will be configured to align with your
document types, fields and lifecycles.
7.1 Required Document Fields Mapping
To create and sync documents to Vault, users in Shaman must provide all required
document fields. During implementation, we configure Shaman to expose only the relevant
metadata for your Vault configuration, ensuring:
● Field names, types, and dependencies mirror your Vault setup
● Required fields are clearly indicated to end users
● Field values are validated before sync
7.2 Dynamic Object Integration
If your Vault implementation uses custom objects (e.g., for message tagging,
segmentation, or campaign associations) that are updated frequently, we can configure a
dynamic sync between Shaman and Vault. This ensures:
● Object values remain current in Shaman
● Users always select from an up-to-date list
● Integration respects object relationships during document creation
7.3 Naming Convention Support
To support consistency and traceability, Shaman can include a document naming generator
based on your internal naming conventions. Naming logic may incorporate values such as:
Brand, Country, Language, Marketing Message, Content Theme etc.
This ensures naming consistency across documents created from different user groups or
geographies.

# Create an MLR Document in Shaman for approved email

In this article:

How to create an MLR document in Shaman and sync your content to OnCore Vault?
Link to an existing MLR document in OnCore Vault
What is MLR document creation in Shaman?
MLR document creation for approved email in Shaman is designed to further simplify the process of creating multi-channel content for OnCore Vault.
An MLR document is a combination of a visual rendition of your email content, and the MLR proof you receive that approves the distribution of the email content you are creating for a specific amount of time and to a specific audience. Without an MLR document, it is not possible to approve content in OnCore Vault and make it available for your end users to users.
We understand that not all of the Shaman users in your organization will have access to OnCore Vault, so we have enabled a tool in Shaman that allows all users to create an MLR document in Shaman and sync their email fragments or templates directly to OnCore Vault (based on the email and your configuration).
The workflow outlined below means that Shaman users only need to contact their local OnCore Vault admin once in the process - to approve the MLR document for distribution and also approve the content (email fragments, email templates, or template fragments) in OnCore Vault.
In this article we will take you through step by step how to create an MLR document, and then sync your content to OnCore Vault.
How to create an MLR document in Shaman and sync your content to OnCoreVault?
Once you have completed the
Veeva settings
,
added copy
,
created a design
and
tested your email
, click on the tab “MLR” from the Overview page of your email fragment or template.
From here, you can export a PDF of your email fragment or email template to then send for review and approval in your FUSE or local approval system.
Export PDF options
Include responsive design (mobile view):
Enabling this option will include a rendition of the mobile version of your email design in the same PDF export as the desktop version.
Compare against previous PDF version:
Compare text of email versions in PDF export: If you have edited the text in your email and saved the versions separately (you can learn more about email versions
here
) you also have the option to compare the current version of your email, with any previous different version side by side in a PDF.
Include document information
Good to know!
If you are exporting an email template, you will see two additional options appear underneath the “PDF file” option: “Include selected email fragments” and “Include selected template fragment”.
You can click these toggles to enable them to show either email fragments or the selected template fragments in the exported PDF file.
Then, click the “Send to Email” button. You will receive the PDF file to your email address within a few minutes.
Good to know!
- A PDF file means you will receive a PDF of your email template or fragment.
- PDF file including related fragments means you will receive the email template and the email fragments used.
Top tip:
Make sure to read our short article in which we explain in more detail what email fragments are and how they can be used.
Here is where the process gets interesting.
You will see two options available in the section "MLR document in Veeva Vault".
Create new:
select this option if you wish to create an MLR document in Shaman
Link to existing:
select this option if you wish to link to an MLR document manually uploaded and approved for distribution in OnCore Vault. Click here to view more information on how to link to an existing MLR document.
Click "create new" to begin the process. You will then be redirected to a page where you can add all the details for your MLR document:
Document Name*:
This field is automatically populated from the name of the corresponding email content you are creating the MLR document for. You can edit the name by simply typing in this field. This is an obligatory field.
Description
: This field is automatically populated from the description of the corresponding email content you are creating the MLR document for. You can edit the name by simply typing in this field. This is an optional field.
Product/Brand*
: This is a dropdown menu, automatically populated with the product/brand assigned to your email template or fragment. This is an obligatory field.
Country*
: This is a dropdown menu, automatically populated with the country assigned to your email template or fragment. This is an obligatory field.
MLR Approval Nr*
: this is a free text field and will usually be a five or six-digit number that can be found on your approval document. This is an obligatory field.
Material Intent*:
Ordinarily there are two options to choose from here, promotional and non-promotional (but this may vary depending on your account settings). You can select the value that matches your approval document. This is an obligatory field.
Audience*:
Ordinarily there are multiple options available in a dropdown menu (eg. Physician, Nurse, etc). You can select the value that matches your approval document. This is an obligatory field.
Language*
:  This is a dropdown menu, automatically populated with the language assigned to your email template or fragment. This is an obligatory field.
Expiry Date*:
Using the calendar which opens when you click on this field, you can select the expiry date which matches your approval document. This is an obligatory field.
Once you have completed these details, you need to attach the document exported from the FUSE/local approval system along with a viewable rendition of the content in PDF form.
MLR document*
is the viewable rendition of the content in PDF (which you can export directly from Shaman using the "Export as PDF" option.
MLR Proof*
is the PDF document or email from the FUSE/local approval system.
You can then click the "Create" button in the top right-hand corner to create your MLR document:
You will be directed to a page where you can view the progress of the creation of the MLR document:
Once the MLR document has been created, you can see your MLR document now attached.
You can now proceed to the "Export" tab to sync your email content to OnCore Vault. Make sure that the "set content to staged lifecycle" is enabled before clicking the "export to Vault" button.
Take a look at
this article
for more information on exporting email content to OnCore Vault.
Link to an existing MLR document in OnCore Vault
To link an MLR document which has been manually uploaded and approved in OnCore Vault, from the "MLR" tab click the "Link to existing" option.
Here you will be able to see all MLR documents which are currently available for use for the Product/brand assigned to the email content you are working with.
Good to know!
If you do not see an MLR document that has recently been uploaded and approved to OnCore Vault, click the "Update button" to retrieve the latest MLR documents.
To select an MLR document from the list, click the small circle next to the corresponding document and then click the "Select" button in the top right corner.
You will then see the MLR document attached to your email content.
You can preview the details of the MLR document (such as creation date, Product/brand, etc) by clicking "Details".
Alternatively, you can remove the MLR document by clicking the "Remove MLR document" button.

nel Content
● Once a document is MLR approved in Vault, Shaman enables users to generate and
sync Multichannel content back into PromoMats. This includes:
○ Email Templates
○ Email Fragments
Page 9/22

○ Fragment Templates
○ Multichannel Presentations (Binder)
○ Multichannel Slides, including Shared Resources
● For each multichannel asset, Shaman can handle metadata population, document
relationships, and the distribution package upload where applicable.
4.3 Component Retrieval and Linking
● Import Approved Assets While authoring content in Shaman, users can browse
and import approved documents (e.g. images, graphs, visuals) stored in Vault. When
imported, the component will be auto resized for the content channel (eg email)
These are typically assets with filtering like:
○ Product/country = Content user is working on
○ Document Type, eg type: Component and subtype: Image or Graph
○ Status = Approved
○ File format = bitmap or PDF
● Component Linking to Final Materials When a new composite asset is created and
synced from Shaman to Vault (e.g. as a Material for MLR review), Shaman can
automatically create document relationships to the approved source components,
maintaining traceability.
4.4 Document Access
● Retrieve Document Lists and Metadata Shaman can query document lists from
Vault (e.g., Materials, Related Pieces, Modular content) including metadata fields.
This enables:
○ Using an existing VVPM MLR document or placeholder in Shaman
○ Auto-linking of Related Pieces
4.5 Object Access
● Retrieve Vault Object Lists Shaman can access custom or standard Vault Objects
(e.g., Message Tags, Campaigns, or Segments) to support metadata mapping and
relationships with documents. This supports downstream targeting and compliance
tagging.

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Hi Theresa,Thank you for getting in touch. Could you please share the URL of the content you are working on in Shaman, and additionally, a screenshot of the approved MLR as it is shown in Veeva?

Customer (Theresa Hermes): This is the url of approved. mail in Shaman:https://ae.eu1.shamancloud.com/takeda-de-neuroscience/approved-emails/template/195/steps/mlr

Customer (Theresa Hermes): Last one is the approved MLR in Veeva.

Customer (Theresa Hermes): Can you help? Is there a way to publish without linking to MLR?

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Thank you for sharing the PDF, Theresa. However, I will need you to send me a screenshot of how you see the MLR in your Veeva account.Please make sure the General information panel is visible in the screenshot.

Customer (Theresa Hermes): Does this help?

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Yes, thank you very much. I will investigate more and get back to you with an update.

Customer (Theresa Hermes): Thank you! This VAE needs go live today or tomorrow. Please let me know when I can expect results. Thanks!

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Thank you for your patience, Theresa.As I can see, in your MLR document in Veeva, the Brand is Neuroscience, which is not an available Brand in the account.​Could you please update the Brand in the MLR to Brand Takeda and then try once more to find the MLR Document in your Shaman account?

Customer (Theresa Hermes): I think the MLR document has Neuroscioence as a product because it is a medical mailing. Are you shure you cannot update the Brand additionally to Neuroscience in Shman?

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Thank you for letting me know, Theresa.As a first solution, we should check if you can update the Brand in the MLR and if after that it will appear in the list of available MLRs. If that is not possible, then we should explore other alternatives.Did you manage to update the Brand in the MLR in your Veeva account?

Customer (Theresa Hermes): Thanks, Sophie. I cannot update the Brand in MLR. I will ask the brand manager to do so. I will come back to you when it is done.

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Thank you so much for the update, Theresa.Please let me know when it's complete, and we will check together if the MLR will appear in this list.​

Customer (Theresa Hermes): Hello! We cannot update the Brand in the MLR as it belongs to ORIKO which is selected as Product Neuroscience in Veeva. I think it would be better in longterm to add Neuroscience as a product/Brand.

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Thank you for trying, Theresa.In this case, we will try to add Brand Neuroscience to the account and check if, by that the MLR will appear.Would you like me to proceed with the request?

Customer (Theresa Hermes): Yes, please proceed. Can you let me know when the addition of the new Brand would be finalized? I need to hold deadlines until tomorrow.

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): For sure, Theresa.I will inform you once the Brand has been added to the account.

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Thank you for your patience, Theresa.The Brand Neuroscience has been added to the account. Could you please change the Brand in the email template and let me know if the MLR now appears in the list of available MLRs?

Customer (Theresa Hermes): Hi Sophie, sure, I will do and come back to you.

Customer (Theresa Hermes): HI Sophie! 1) I cannot find any Neuroscience product or brand in Overview, 2) there is no filter for neuroscience in MLR, 3) I can see in MLR page tat only assets until 6th November are visable. That might be a problem.

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Hi Theresa,If you refresh the page, you will see the new Brand. I also tried to update the list of available MLRs and the one we want for this email is not there.I will take a closer look and get back to you shortly.

Customer (Theresa Hermes): Now I see the product, but the document is missing. Can you find it? How do you usually look it up - via ID or document name?

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Both ways normally work. In this case, you will need to manually link the MLR to the email template in Veeva.I will keep investigating the situation and will get back to you with more information tomorrow.Thank you for the cooperation on this one, Theresa.​

Customer (Theresa Hermes): Hi Sophie, now I could find the MLR document and link it to the approved mail. Thank you!

Customer (Theresa Hermes): One last question: What happens if I link the MLR documet manually in Shaman? Does it open another MLR in Veeva?

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Goodmorning Theresa,Hope you had a nice afternoon.To link the MLR to the email template, please open the email template document in Veeva PromoMats (this is the link to the email template in Veeva:https://shire-promomats-international.veevavault.com/ui/#doc_info/1563082) and navigate to theRelationshiptab on the right hand side, under the sectionOther Related Documents, click on the plus symbol, a window will appear where you can search for the MLR document to link the email template.​Here is an example from our Vault:Additionally, what do you mean when you say link manually the MLR in Shaman? The MLR document is not appearing in Shaman, this is why you will need to link it manually in Veeva.Looking forward to your reply.

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Hi Theresa,As I can see, you have successfully linked the MLR to the email template.Is there anything else I could help you with?

Agent (Sophie Dimopoulou): Hi Theresa,I will close this conversation for now, since we did not receive any answer from your side.

ntent Review and Approval
Once content is created in Veeva Vault as material, content owners can initiate and
manage the Medical, Legal, and Regulatory (MLR) review process in VVPM as usual.
Page 5/22

2.3 Content Publishing
Upon MLR approval in VVPM, Shaman can auto-generate final HTML output ready for
publishing.
Publishing workflow depends on content type:
● For Detail Aids (CLM) and Approved Email: Users auto-generate HTML content in
Shaman and sync it into Veeva Vault PromoMats as Email Templates, Email
Fragments, Template Fragments, or Multichannel Presentation with
Multichannel Slides. Metadata can be configured directly in Shaman or inherited
from the source Material document. Depending on your SOP, documents can be
automatically linked (e.g., to approved reference documents) during the sync
process.
● For other content channels/ platforms (eg marketing email, web): Users
auto-generate HTML content in Shaman to download for other platforms.
NB 1: Content is locked from export until it reaches the appropriate approved state in Vault. This
ensures regulatory alignment and reduces the risk of premature distribution.
NB 2: Shaman is not a publishing platform.
2.4 Document Lifecycle Tracking and Permissions
Once synced to Vault, content in Shaman is linked to the Veeva Document ID. This
enables Shaman to:
● Track the document’s lifecycle state in real time
● Control what actions users can perform based on lifecycle stage (e.g., restrict
editing of content in review, restrict export of non approved content)
● Support version-specific logic for editability, exportability, and compliance
checks
This tight integration ensures that content remains consistent across systems, aligns
with your SOPs, and respects Vault governance protocols — while unlocking a more
efficient and user-friendly content creation process.

## Action Context:

The user is being guided through a two-step transition: first accessing Shaman from Veeva Vault using the right-click context menu option, then navigating to the Design tab within Shaman to continue editing the email workflow. This represents a typical handoff between document management (Vault) and workflow design (Shaman) systems.]

# Veeva labels

Path: Admin Space

Veeva Labels are used in Shaman Superadmin to configure Shaman accounts for the customers Veeva Vault Configuration to ensure succesful sync between Shaman and Vault Promomats.
How are Veeva labels used?
With Veeva label you can manage the creation and mapping of Veeva fields in Shaman. Veeva labels will inform:
Fields to be included in a Veeva API Call, to create, update or view (fetch) data.
Map fields by configuring the right Veeva API name and correct value options.
Enable fields (show) in Veeva information/ Veeva Details cards in Shaman. Most fields are required (determined in front end html) and if enabled, Shaman will also validate for these fields
Structure of Veeva labels
When defining a Veeva Label you need to add the following fields:
VeevaVaultLabelType
The object of the field
Name
Existing field name, maps field with Front end html and in some cases with Veeva Connections (lambda functions).

1. Why Shaman Content Authoring
1.1 Introduction and the Shaman Approach
Shaman is your partner on the journey to content excellence. In today’s life sciences
landscape, content is a critical enabler — powering commercial success across field
teams and omnichannel marketing. Next it fuels sales force effectiveness,
segmentation strategies, and next-best action recommendations. All these depend on
producing the right content, at the right time.
Veeva Vault PromoMats plays a central role in this content ecosystem, acting as the
system of record for compliant content management. Shaman complements this by
addressing a major upstream challenge: how content is created. As a self-service
content authoring platform, Shaman provides a scalable, structured, and predictable
way to allow local brand teams to generate high-quality content, ready for MLR review.
By integrating seamlessly with Veeva Vault, Shaman Content Authoring:
● Empowers content creators to work faster and more autonomously
● Significantly reduces content production costs and timelines
● Enables greater reuse and consistency of messaging across brands, markets,
and channels
● Drives adoption by embedding into existing governance frameworks (SOPs,
permissions, lifecycles)
While Shaman is a SaaS platform, our approach goes beyond technology — it combines
software, services, and consultancy. We invest heavily in onboarding and adoption,
working closely with your teams to align our platform with your organizational needs
and regulatory requirements.

Title: Veeva owner manual assignment in Shaman (part 1)
URL: https://shamanapp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ADMIN/pages/1473576972

# Veeva owner manual assignment in Shaman

Path: Admin Space > Config & Ops > Superadmin - Account settings

Shaman users can now manually select the appropriate document owner when syncing content and MLR documents to Veeva Vault.
Document owners can manage settings, run workflows, and track progress in Veeva Vault. (Previously “Shaman integration user” was automatically assigned as Document owner, which meant users had to manually assign themselves to documents to manage settings, track progress of a document, etc). This feature streamlines the workflow of Shaman to Veeva Vault even further, removing the manually assignment of Veeva owner step in Veeva Vault.
How it works: A field called “Document Owner in Veeva Vault” appears in MLR creation AND OR HTML doc creation (depending on which feature(s) are enabled. Users can select a Veeva owner for the MLR/ document.
These are referred to in Superadmin as “Veeva owners”. Veeva owners do not need to be Shaman users.
This can be enabled for MLR documents, HTML documents, or both.
Summary of how to enable steps:
Request list of Veeva owner(s) from client. Make sure to request: Full name, email address (NB: email address is used as identifier) and Veeva ID.
We can only change ownership after Shaman integration user also has access to the document using a Sharing setting.

Agent (Cherokee Hillman): Hi Michaela, thank you for getting in touch.

Agent (Cherokee Hillman): To revive expired content back to approved or staged, first, the expired content must be duplicated in Shaman, creating a completely new piece of content. The process then starts from the beginning - add MLR information, and sync to Veeva Vault before manually approving in Veeva Vault.Please let me know if you have any questions.

Agent (Cherokee Hillman): Please bear with me a moment while a take a closer look at this template.

Agent (Cherokee Hillman): I noticed that the Veeva status was not updated automatically. However, after the status was manually updated, Shaman is now reflecting the most recent Veeva status:

Customer (Michaela Hoffmann): OK - than I have to duplicate it and start the  whole process

Agent (Cherokee Hillman): Once a piece of content expires in Vault, it cannot be reverted to the approved status. To simplify the process, Shaman allows you to duplicate the content which you can then re-sync as a new template to Vault.Please let me know if we can assist you with anything else today.

Customer (Michaela Hoffmann): OK Thank you Cherokee

# How to create an MLR document for Marketing Email content in Shaman

In this article:
An introduction to MLR documents for Marketing Email content
How to create an MLR document for Marketing Email content in Shaman
An introduction to MLR documents for Marketing Email content
Although Marketing Email templates and dynamic content blocks are not synced and distributed via Veeva Vault, it is still important to be compliant and consistent with every Email that reaches your HCPs. Whilst there is no relation between Salesforce Marketing Cloud and Veeva Vault, there should still be proof that a document has been through the MLR review process.
An MLR document is a combination of a visual rendition of your email content, and the MLR proof you receive that approves the distribution of the email content you are creating for a specific amount of time and to a specific audience.
In Shaman, you can easily and quickly create MLR documents for both Marketing email templates and dynamic content blocks. Let's take a closer look.
How to create an MLR document for Marketing Email content in Shaman
Once you are ready to create an MLR document for a Marketing email template or dynamic content block, click the “MLR” tab.
From here, you can export a PDF of your email template or dynamic content block to then send for review and approval, in case you use a different system than Veeva Vault for MLR review and approval.
Export PDF options
Include responsive design (mobile view): Enabling this option will include a rendition of the mobile version of your email design in the same PDF export as the desktop version.
Compare against previous PDF version: If you need to resubmit your content for approval, and want to include a comparison against a previous version (for example; one that was returned during review, or a previously approved version) you can easily do so by enabling the toggle.
Include document information: Enable this toggle to include the metadata of the Email document in the PDF export.
Good to know!
If you are exporting a Marketing email template, you will see an additional option appear underneath the “PDF file” option: “Include email dynamic content”
You can click this toggle to include dynamic content blocks in the exported PDF file, and approve the campaign as a whole.
To export your PDF, you can either download directly or click "Send to Email" - your PDF export will be in your Email inbox within a few minutes.
You will see two options available in the section "MLR document in Veeva Vault".
Create new: select this option if you wish to create an MLR document in Shaman
Link to existing: select this option if you wish to link to an existing MLR document that is readily available in your Veeva Vault.
Click "create new" to begin the process. You will then be redirected to a page where you can add all the details for your MLR document:
Name*: This field is automatically populated from the name of the corresponding email content you are creating the MLR document for. You can edit the name by simply typing in this field. This is a mandatory field.
Description: This field is automatically populated from the description of the corresponding email content you are creating the MLR document for. You can edit the name by simply typing in this field. This is an optional field.
Brand*: This is a dropdown menu, automatically populated with the brand assigned to your email template or dynamic content block. This is a mandatory field.
Language*: This is a dropdown menu, automatically populated with the language assigned to your email content. This is a mandatory field.
Country*: This is a dropdown menu, automatically populated with the country assigned to your email content. This is a mandatory field.
Expiry Date*: Using the calendar which opens when you click on this field, you can select the expiry date of the MLR document. This is a mandatory field.
Then click “Create” in the top right corner to create the MLR document.
You will then be able to view the MLR document and corresponding details attached in the MLR section of your email content.
The next step is to export the email content from Shaman, take a look at

[2025-01-10] Katy Moore: Good afternoon,
Please could I confirm what the workflow should be when working with Veeva hosted documents in Takeda accounts?
<https://app.intercom.com/a/inbox/o1w0qyxm/inbox/admin/5298352/conversation/12309200070254?view=List|Richard Coonan at Takeda UK Oncology> is asking when creating an email template with a vault document linked to it (one that has been manually uploaded to Veeva Vault, not created in Shaman), is it necessary to create two separate jobs for both the email template, and the vault document? Or one job can be used for both?
I understand this is not necessarily Shaman related (more on the Veeva Promomats side) but would be good to know for our understanding.
Many thanks
  → Xavier Verbij: @Katy Moore, the hosted document should be approved in advance before this can be added to the email template. Which means that two jobs need to be created. One job in Veeva for the hosted document and one job, which can be made through Shaman, for the VAE.
  → Katy Moore: OK thank you, I will let Richard know but perhaps if you have any upcoming meetings with him you can clarify this with him in person.
