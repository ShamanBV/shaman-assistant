    "body": "In this article:\nWhat is the HTML Banner Builder?\nParts of an HTML Banner\nDesigning your HTML Banner\nWorking with Overlays\nPrepare for MLR\nExporting your HTML Banner\nWhat is the HTML Banner Builder?\nIn Shaman, marketers can easily create compliant visual banners (static or animated) with a (scrollable) text overlay, eg for mandatory Important Safety Information (ISI). After approval, the banner can be exported as ready-to-use HTML, aligned with IAB banner guidelines. This package is used to publish the banner across ad networks, like Google Ads.\nThe HTML Banner Builder is available as an optional feature within the Visual Builder.\nParts of an HTML Banner\nAn html banner usually has the dimensions of a common banner type like sky scraper, leaderboard or rectangle.\nThe visual you create or select will represent those size dimensions. When you create a new banner and select the banner subtype, Shaman will propose the official sizes.\nThe text overlay will be placed on top of this visual. You can set the position. Usually it will be placed at the bottom or on the right side (landscape format).\nPlease note that this means the visual part of the visual is smaller than the full visual!\n\u200b\nIn the text overlay you can set:\nheader (text and hyperlinks), will not scroll and always remain visible\nbody (text, images, hyperlinks), will be scrollable and autoscroll.\nDesigning your HTML Banner\nTo get started, open the Visual Builder, select the HTML Banner tab and click \"New\" like so:\nA window will appear prompting you to enter the required details such as brand, name, and language. Once these are completed, you can continue in the Overview tab to finalise the visual component details. Next you can create and edit the visual (Design), manage the text and position of the overlay (Overlay) and start the MLR process (MLR). Once done, the banner is ready to be exported (Export) and published in an Ad network.\nThe creation and design of a html banner is similar to a visual. For a more detailed overview of creating a new visual component, setting the details in the Overview page, and designing the visuals in the Design stage, please refer to\nthis article\n.\nFrom the Design tab, you will be presented with a dropdown list of the different visual component types, ensure to select the type\nHTML Banner\n.\nIn the Start Designing dropdown, you can choose how you want to start:\nBlank canvas:\ncreate an HTML Banner \u201cfrom scratch\u201d\nType of files accepted:\n.JPG, .PNG, .HEIC, .TIFF, .SVG, .PDF (single page PDFs)\nStart with template\n\u2013 use an existing HTML banner design template to get started.\nIf you wish to make the image elements of your HTML Banner animated, ensure to enable the toggle\nAnimated\nbefore proceeding to the next step.\nGood to know!\nThis means that existing visuals in Shaman, both static and animated, can be reused as HTML banner. You have 2 options to reuse:\nUse an existing visual template\nDuplicate a visual and change type to: HTML Banner\nWorking with Overlays\nThe overlay is an HTML layer containing text, links, and images, managed directly in Shaman. Once created, an overlay is saved in a reusable library (brand-specific if selected), allowing teams to quickly apply it across multiple banners. This not only saves time but also ensures consistency and compliance.\nIn the Text overlay card, you can either create a new text overlay or select an existing one:\nCreate a new text overlay\nWhen creating a new overlay, add:\nHeader section\nThis section is non-scrollable, it will stick at the top of the scrollable text. So make sure to keep the text short. You can use rich text editor options to add hyperlinks, change color, add superscript.\nBody section\nThis section is scrollable, it will auto scroll and scrollable by viewer. You can add full ISI text (limit 5000 chars).  You can use rich text editor options to add hyperlinks, add bullets, change color, add superscript. You can also add images (from the visual library) in line in the text. Once added, you can resize images in the text.\nNB: Size limits (300kb or even 200kb) is a big challenge when creating banners. If you want to insert images, you should resize those images before uploading (or change file size in the Shaman image editor) and only use images as small as possible. Ideally, they are so small you don't need to resize them in the Body.\nWhen you make changes to the overlay, you can immediately preview the results below in the Preview card.\nOnce done, you can save the Text overlay and reuse in other banners.\nWhen you create the MLR document (PDF), the Text overlay will be added for review.\nWhen the text is brand specific, you should restrict the use of the overlay for a specific brand by enabling the \"Brand related\" toggle. In that case, the Text Overlay will only appear in the list of Text Overlays when working on HTML banners of the same brand.\nGood to know!\nWhen you change a Text Overlay, these changes will apply for all banners where the Text overlay is used (see column 'Where Used' to find these banners). To apply this change, these other banners need to be re-exported.\nOnce the Text overlay is set, you return to the banner overlay. Below in the\nConfigure Overlay\nsection, you can set the following configurations:\nPosition of overlay\n- Determines where do you want to have the overlay (bottom, left, right, top)\nSize overlay\n- Defines the pixel dimensions of the overlay and how much space it occupies within the design\nOpacity overlay background -\nAllows you to set a percentage of opacity for the text section of your overlay\nTarget url -\nYou can add a URL where the user will be directed to when they click on the HTML banner (visual area - the clicks in the text overlay can be set using hyperlinks).\nFrom the\nPreview\nsection, you can view your HTML banner exactly as it will appear once published. Any changes you make in the design or overlay configuration will be reflected here in real time, allowing you to check that the layout, text, and visuals appear as intended.\nStart the MLR process\nWhen the banner visual and overlay are ready, you can prepare for the MLR process. Go to the MLR tab, where you can sync the content to Veeva Vault, either by creating a new MLR document in Vault with rendition in Shaman, or link to an existing placeholder and sync the rendition file (PDF). When generating the HTML banner rendition PDF, Shaman will add:\nOverlay on top of the visual; showing the final viewable result\nIf animated, Shaman will generate a frame per scene, incl the overlay\nAdditional page in PDF containing the full Body section of the overlay, including clickable links.\nFrom this section, you can also export your HTML banner as a PDF file. In that case, these PDF additions are optional:\nThis article\nprovides detailed, step-by-step instructions for the MLR process and exporting your visual component.\nExporting your HTML Banner\nWhen the banner is MLR reviewed and approved, you can proceed to the Export tab.\nHere, you can download the HTML package of the banner (zip), including:\nindex.html\n\\assets\nimage visual (png or gif)\nother images used in the body section\nIt is important that you check the size of the .zip before you send it to the publishing platform. Most platforms have a size limitation, the official AIB guidelines is 300kb.\nEspecially when you have an animated banner, this can be challenging. In that case make sure you set lowest export settings:\nOther tips to reduce gif file size:\nremove text and shape animations\nremove transitions\nreduce duration\nYou can also refer to\nthis article\nfor more information on creating animated visuals in Shaman.",

Content Review offers an easier to use UI (than Audit),  effortlessly integrating with your existing Design process, as well as even more useful functionalities than before.\nWe hope that by bringing these details to your attention during the content creation process (rather than in the testing process), Content Review will save you time and syncs.\nContent Review can be tailored specifically to your account requirements, so get in touch with your dedicated Customer Success manager to find out how your content creation team can start benefiting from this great new feature.\nHow does Content Review work?\nContent Review scans the content of your email design, and based on which Critical and Warning options you have chosen (as part of your account configuration), you might see:\nCritical:\nObservations which must be \u201cresolved\u201d before syncing to Veeva Vault:\nUnsubscribe link missing: This notification will show if there is no URL/ Veeva token which offers readers the option to \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d from the email campaign\nVeeva tokens: You will be notified if a Veeva token is incomplete or incorrectly completed.\n\u200b\u200bButton link missing: This notification will show there is no Action (eg. open a URL, send an email, download a Veeva hosted document) added to a button.\nHyper text link is missing: You will be notified if there is no URL/ Veeva token populated in a hyperlink created for text in an email.\nWarning suggestions:\nYou can decide to not address the Warning suggestions and sync content to Veeva Vault with open Warning notifications.

    "body": "In this article:\nWhat are content analytics\nInformation available in content analytics\nUsing search filters to refine the available data\nAdditional options per statistic\nOverall numbers\nTrends\nWhat are content analytics\n\u201cContent analytics\u201d can be found in the first tab in Usage Analytics in Shaman. As the name suggests, this section provides insightful statistics on what content is being created, what type of document, which content is being synced to Veeva Vault, by which country, therapeutic area, for which brand, and how it is being created - from a design template or from scratch.\nInformation available in content analytics\nUsing search filters to refine the available data\nUsing the search filters at the top of the page, you can refine your statistics search to include specific countries, Shaman accounts or a specific date range.\nYou can select a single or multiple countries using the corresponding check box next to the country (or countries) you wish to select.\nIf you have multiple Shaman accounts (for example different accounts for separate therapeutic areas) you can choose a single or multiple Shaman accounts to view (using the checkbox in the drop down list of Shaman accounts).\nIn the date range section you can refine the data available to a specific time period. This is extremely useful for refining information by quarter, or even annually or monthly. Simply select the date range by either using the calendar or you can also manually input the date directly into the date range field.\nAdditional options when viewing usage analytics\nWhen you hover over each set of statistics in Shaman, you will see additional options in the top right corner of the infographic box which allow you to:\nMaximize (the statistic window)\nView applied filters (in the most recent search)\nDrill down from Document Type (break down statistic into document types - where relevant).\nView summary data/ Export to CSV\nOverall numbers\nThe first section of data presents \u201cOverall numbers\u201d of total documents created in Shaman. Let\u00b4s take a closer look.\nTotal documents created: Total documents with breakdown per document type/subtype.\nIn this infographic you can see at a glance the percentage of content being created in Shaman, across all of the Shaman builders (e.g. approved email, CLM presentation or Visual components.)\nVeeva status documents: Total documents with breakdown Veeva status\nHere you can see which percentage of content has been synced to Veeva Vault, and what status the content has in Veeva Vault. This information is a total of all the content created across the builders in Shaman, so it may surprise you to know just how much of the content created in Shaman is approved in Veeva Vault!\nVeeva commits per document: How often a document is synced with Vault\nOrdinarily a sync to Veeva Vault will only happen after:\nChanges have been made to the content itself\nThe MLR document has been updated\nThis very useful statistic reveals how much content is being created and synced just once, and how much content receives multiple updates and syncs to Veeva Vault.\nContent created per country: Map with documents per country\nIn a map infographic you can see at a glance which countries have created more (or less) content. The deeper the shade of green of the country, the more content created in that country.\nContent created per brand: Overview of (sub)documents per brand\nIn this graph you can see which brands have had the most documents created, followed by all brands in the accounts selected (in order of most to least documents created). In each brand, you can also see a breakdown of which type of content is being created (eg. Approved email, Marketing email, Slide projects or CLM presentations).\nContent type created per country: New content types created per country\nIn this graph you can see which countries have had the most documents created, followed by all countries included in the search (in order of most to least documents created). In each country, you can also see a breakdown of which type of content is being created (eg. Approved email, Marketing email, Slide projects or CLM presentations).\nContent matrix per country and brand: Document creation heat map per country/ brand\nIn this infographic you can see how many documents have been created for each brand, in each of the countries selected. In addition, the higher the number of documents, the deeper the shade of green will be. So you can see at a glance which countries have been creating the most content, and for which brand.\nContent type created per account: New content types created per account\nHere you can check how many new documents have been created (rather than being duplicated from an existing document), and again you can see a breakdown of which types of content are being created.\nStart document creation: How new documents are created - per type\nIn this infographic you can see at a glance how much content is being created \u201cfrom scratch\u201d (that is to say, a new blank document), duplicated from existing documents, duplicated from hub, or created from a design template. This can be extremely useful to know how much content in each account is being reused and recycled, and which content tends to be created from scratch each time.\nTrends\nContent creation trend: Content creation last 90 days vs quarter before\nIn this section you can see how much content has been created in comparison with content created in the quarter before. This includes all types of content created in Shaman (CLM presentation, approved email, marketing email, slide projects and visual components).\nNew documents created: New documents per month\nThis infographic contains how many new documents have been created per month, illustrating the highs and lows of content creation over the last year.\nNew document types created: New documents per document type month\nHere you can see how many new documents have been created in the last year, broken down into types of content.\nNew documents per brand (top5): New documents per brand (top5) per month\nIn this infographic you can see a comparison between new documents created for the \u201cTop 5\u201d brands. The \u201cTop 5\u201d refers to the 5 brands which have had the most content created.\nNew documents per TA: New documents per TA per month\nHere you can review the new documents created per TA - TA refers to therapeutic area rather than country or brand.\nNew documents per country (top5): New documents per country (top5) per month\nIn this infographic you can see a comparison between new documents created for the \u201cTop 5\u201d countries. The \u201cTop 5\u201d refers to the 5 countries which have had the most content created.\nDocuments vs templates\nDocument / template ratio per content type illustrates how many documents have been created per design template.\nTotal documents created\nTotal documents with breakdown per document type/ subtype\nHere you can see at a glance the percentage of different types of content created in Shaman. For example, 51% of content created in the test account in the screenshot is approved email.",

    "body": "In this article:\nIntroduction to working with icons\nHow to add icons to email content\nHow to update existing icons\nHow to delete or duplicate icons\nIntroduction to working with icons\nIcons visually communicate ideas in a simple and straightforward way, making them the perfect companion to text in email content. Icons can also boost your brand identity, and guide your reader towards the most important content in your email.\nSo we are delighted to let you know that we have added a section in the Visual library just for icons in Shaman! Official brand icons can be added in bulk by the Shaman team and then can be seamlessly made available to your content teams in branded colors.\nIf you would like to learn more about how to activate the Icon library in your Shaman account, please reach out to your dedicated Customer Success Manager.\nIf the Icon library is already active in your account, carry on reading to find out how you can easily add icons to your email content.\nHow to add icons to email content\nLet\u00b4s imagine that you have created a new email fragment or template, have completed the email details, and are now in the HTML editor ready to add elements to your email fragment or template. (If you need to revise any of these steps,\ncheck out this article here).\nFrom the menus on the right-hand side, select the content menu. Find the image icon in the content menu, and simply drag and drop that icon onto your email canvas.\nYou will notice that a grey placeholder image has been added to the email canvas. To add an icon to the email canvas instead, click the \u201cVisual library\u201d button from the menu on the left-hand side.\nYou will then be redirected to the visual library, where you will see the tab \u201cIcons\u201d available to select.\nHere you will find a list of icons supplied by your brand lead to Shaman. You can browse through the list of icons, or you can use the search bar or time filters to find the icon you are looking for:\nTo select an icon to add to your canvas, simply click the selection circle which will reveal the \u201cAdd\u201d button in the top right hand corner:\nOnce you have clicked \u201cAdd\u201d, you will see a list of pre-added brand colours available to select. Choose the colour which you would like to assign to the icon.\nYou will then be redirected back to the email canvas, where the icon will be added to the email canvas in the selected brand color.\nUsing the menu on the right-hand side, you can then define additional optional settings for the image.\nAuto Width: This setting is a toggle that sets an image automatically to fit the width of your email content. To set the width of an image manually, you can disable the auto width toggle and use the slider to resize your image bigger or smaller.\nAlign: This setting allows you to define the alignment of your image in relation to your email content by selecting from the left, center, right, or full alignment icons.\nAlternate Text: Alternative Text is meant to convey the \u201cwhy\u201d of the image as it relates to the content of a document or webpage. It also displays on the page if the image fails to load.\nIf you wish to have alternative text for your image, you can add it to this field simply by typing directly into the box available.\nAction: Here you can add an action such as if the email recipient clicks on the image, a specific webpage will be opened. There are several options to choose from in the dropdown menu on the right-hand side (which shows \u201cOpen Website\u201d as a default action).\nOpen website\nSend email\nCall phone number\nSend SMS\nDepending on which option you choose, additional fields will be displayed to further personalize the action. For example, if you choose the \u201cOpen Website\u201d option, you will need to populate the URL link in the field provided. You can also define whether a new tab is opened, or if the webpage is viewed on the same tab in the reader's browser.\nTop tip!\nWhen using the \u201cOpen website\u201d option, we always recommend you copy the URL directly from the browser before pasting it in this URL field to avoid any typos or incorrect links.\nContainer Padding: Padding can be used to perfectly position images within the body of your email content. You can choose to add the same padding to all sides by maintaining the \u201cAll sides\u201d toggle enabled. Or, you can disable this toggle to manually configure the padding size for each side of the image. You can use the plus and minus icons to increase or decrease the padding, or you can type a numerical value directly into the padding box.\nHide on Desktop: When this toggle is enabled, the image will not be displayed when viewing the email on a desktop computer or laptop, it will only be viewable on a mobile view.\nGood to know!\nWe highly recommend you pay attention to how your email content looks on both mobile and desktop views. To learn more great tips when creating email content compatible with mobile and desktop views, take a look at\nthis article here.\nHow to update an existing icon with a new icon\nIf you want to change an icon that has already been added to the email canvas, select the icon by clicking on it. Then, from the menu on the left-hand side, click the \u201cVisual library\u201d button.\nYou will be redirected back to the Visual library where you can select a different icon following the same steps as previously stated.\nYou will then be redirected back to the email canvas, where the selected icon will be added to the email canvas.\nHow to delete or duplicate icons\nTo delete an icon, simply click the icon to select it. You will then notice two icons - a bin icon to delete the image, and a copy icon to duplicate it.\nDepending on which you wish to do, simply click the icon, and your image will either be deleted or duplicated.",

    "body": "In this article:\nIntroduction\nHow to create an Animated visual in Shaman\nScenes\nLocking\nAudio\nAnimation\nExport visual component as a PDF (for MLR)\nExport visual component to Shaman visual library, or as a GIF file to your computer\nIntroduction\nYou can now create animated visual components (commonly known as GIFs) in the Shaman Visual builder! GIFs are a great way of engaging your audience by maximizing the potential of your visual content.\nBefore we get started:\nWe highly recommend that you keep GIFs as light in size as possible, as heavy visual files will cause difficulties for approved email content. The more scenes and animations you add to a visual file, the heavier/ larger the file will be.\nIf you have any doubts about creating a new visual component in Shaman, you can take a look at\nthis article\n.\nHow to create an Animated visual in Shaman\nOnce you have created a new visual component, set the obligatory information such as brand or name, and clicked the \u201cDesign\u201d tab  and selected the \u201cType\u201d of visual component you are creating, you will see the \u201cAnimated\u201d field appear beneath \u201cSubtype\u201d.\nGood to know!\nCurrently Shaman supports a maximum file size of 480k pixels (800*600).\nOnce you have selected a \u201cSubtype\u201d, you can simply click the \u201cAnimated\u201d checkbox and then click \u201cCreate canvas\u201d\nYou will then be redirected to the visual builder canvas. Once you have added some visual content to the canvas, you will see the following options on the right hand side:\nScenes: If you wish to add more than one visual to the Animated GIF, you can add different \u201cscenes\u201d which hold the different images\nLocking: Here you can configure \u201clocking\u201d to prevent parts of the visual component from being edited.\nAudio: Please do not add any audio files to visual components as they are not currently supported in Shaman. Any audio files added to Animated visuals will be removed when the visual elements are added to the email builder.\nAnimation: Select an animation effect for each scene in your visual component\nAcross the bottom of the email canvas you will see some additional options for the animation element of the GIF:\nPlay scene: Click play to view the animations within the current scene you are viewing\nPlay all: Click play to preview the animations across all scenes created\nPlus icon: Shortcut to create a new scene\nCopy icon: Shortcut to duplicate a scene\nBin icon: Shortcut to delete a scene\nNavigation arrows: Shortcut to navigate between scenes\nNow that you are familiar with the GIF canvas, we will take a look at each of the following menus in more detail:\nScenes\nLocking\nAnimation\nScenes\nAs mentioned previously, you can add different \u201cscenes\u201d to an animated file which hold different images within the GIF. At any stage in the scene creation process you can add other text, images or shapes and add animation effects as desired\n(see the Animation section here\n).\nTo add a new scene, simply click the \u201cAdd\u201d button in the menu on the right hand side.\nTo increase or decrease the duration of a scene, use the arrows next to the timings under the scene preview thumbnail in the menu on the right hand side.\nWhen you click the three dots under the scene preview, you will see the following additional options:\nAdd Scene name: You can add a name to your scene to help keep track of the different scenes within your animated GIF.\nClone: Click here to duplicate the scene\nSplit into scene slides: You can split a scene into further \u201cchild\u201d scenes, allowing you to add animation effects between the same visual (applied to different scenes).\nDelete: Click here to delete a scene.\nConvert to layout: Click here to convert the scene to a layout.\nGood to know!\nLayouts work in a similar way to a design template in that you can create a layout, and then create new scenes using this layout.\nLocking\nThe \u201clocking\u201d tool (when used in a design template) ensures that obligatory visual (eg. a brand logo) or written information (eg. legal disclaimers, dosing information, etc) which should not be updated or edited is out of bounds for anyone but the creator of the template.\nWhat elements can I lock in Shaman?\nText\nImages (Media)\nShapes\nBackground\nAudio\nAs mentioned previously in this article: Please do not add any audio files to visual components as they are not currently supported in Shaman. Any audio files added to Animated visuals will be removed when the visual elements are added to the email builder.\nAnimation\nUsing the animation tab, a variety of animations can be applied to the \u201cintro\u201d or \u201coutro\u201d of a selected scene, or all scenes.\n\u201cIntro\u201d refers to the animation that can be applied to the beginning or arrival of the content element to the scene, whereas the \u201coutro\u201d refers to the animation that can be applied to the ending or exit of the content element from a scene.\nThe options available are:\nNone: Select this option to not apply any animation to your visual element.\nFade\nPan\nRise\nPop\nUnite\nTumble\nScale\nTrample\nSimply click an option to select it. Once you have selected an animation option, you will see two further options:\nDelay: The element(s) will not be visible until this delay has elapsed, at which point the animation will play\nDuration: This refers to how long the animation will take to complete.\nGood to know!\nIf the delay and duration together exceed the total duration of the scene, a warning message will appear advising you to adjust either delay, duration of animation or duration of the scene.\nYou see in the menu on the right hand side a button to \u201cApply to all elements\u201d. This will apply the chosen animation to all content elements within the scene (if you have more than one content element on the canvas).\nOnce you are happy with the Animated visual created, the next step is to export or publish the animated visual using the \u201cExport\u201d page.\nExport visual component as a PDF (for MLR)\nFrom the \u201cMLR\u201d tab you can export a PDF document to arrive in your email inbox, or use the \u201cDownload\u201d option to download the PDF directly to your computer.\nExport visual component to Shaman visual library, or as a GIF file to your computer\nFrom the design canvas, click the \u201cExport\u201d tab to be directed to the list of Export options in Shaman.\nThe first section we should review contains the \u201cAnimated gif details\u201d, where we need to set:\nFrames per second: Here you can set the animation smoothness and file size. The higher the frames per second, the higher the animation smoothness (but also higher the file size). In general, we suggest 5 FPS or lower to keep file size manageable, especially for banners with limits. We recommend you to use higher FPS only if you are using animation effects.\nQuality: The quality is a balance between the quality of the visual and the file size. Medium is usually sufficient quality to keep the file size within size limits, whilst maintaining a good standard of image quality. You can adjust the quality based on the animation detail.\nLoop: Determines whether the animation repeats. When enabled, the animation will continuously loop. When disabled, it will play once and stop at the final frame.\nNext you can decide whether you wish to share the Animated Visual to your internal Hub (if relevant!).\nTo export your Animated visual to the Shaman library, you can click the \u201cExport\u201d button, or alternatively click \u201cSend to Email\u201d or \u201cDownload\u201d to receive the GIF file to your inbox, or to your computer.\nAdd the GIF to your email\nTo add the GIF to your email, start by adding the image placeholder to the body of your email, then open the \"Visual Library\".\nIn the Visual Library, click on the GIF you exported from the Visual Builder.\nThe GIF will immediately be added to the email body.\nIf you have any questions or face any challenges, please reach out to our Support Team using the chat bubble on the bottom right corner, or email us at\nsupport@getshaman.com\n.",

    "description": "Take a look at the Shaman teams top tips when creating email content in Outlook",
    "body": "In this article:\nIntroduction\nBackground images\nWeb fonts and web safe fonts\nButtons populated with an incomplete URL or Veeva token (outlook.com)\nAnimated GIFs\nWorking with padding and images\nIntroduction\nAt Shaman, we help our users to create and test email content for a range of email inbox providers (eg. Apple mail, Gmail or Outlook) on a daily basis. We have learnt a lot of handy tips when working with different email clients over time, but the one email client provider that we receive the most questions about is: Outlook.\nPerhaps you have experienced a heading not rendering as expected when testing in Outlook, or some images which are showing with a different alignment than the one you designed? In which case, this article is for you!\nWe would like to thank our users who have inspired this article and we sincerely hope that this list of best practices and tips is helpful.\nBackground images\nIn Outlook, background images can cause other content elements which are placed in the same row to render unexpectedly.\nLet\u00b4s take a look at an example. Here you can see a background image:\nWith two images placed on top (using the Image element in the content menu):\nGmail preview:\nApple mail preview:\nOutlook preview:\nRecommendation/ solution:\nCreate a single image which layers the background image with the other content elements on top:\nGmail preview:\nApple mail preview:\nOutlook preview:\nConsider updating the email design without using a background image (for example, splitting the background image into two columns:\nGmail preview:\nApple mail preview:\nOutlook preview:\nWeb fonts and web safe fonts\nLet\u00b4s take a quick look at what are web fonts, and web safe fonts\nWeb safe fonts: Prompt the web browser to retrieve the font from the pre installed fonts on your computer. Web safe fonts (as the name suggests!) are safe to use, as it is very likely the person reading the email will have them.\nExamples: Arial, Helvetica, Tahoma, Times New Roman.\nOn the contrary, web fonts are retrieved from a server hosted by an external source (or by your own server). The variety of fonts is much greater, but - they are only supported in a limited number of email clients. And yes you have guessed it, Outlook is not one of the email clients which supports web fonts.\nExamples: Poppins, Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat\nSo what happens in Shaman if you use a web font in Shaman, but the end user views the email content in Outlook? In Shaman, your account fonts are configured to always have a web safe back-up font, for any web font selected. For example, font selected: Montserrat, back up font: Arial.\nYou can\u00b4t see this \u201cback up\u201d font in the email editor, but we can see it is there, in these litmus previews that in Outlook (an email provider which does not support web fonts), the text is rendered using Arial:\nOutlook preview:\nIn apple mail preview:\nRecommendation/ Solution:\nMake sure that any fonts you are choosing (web safe fonts or web fonts) are looking good across a range of email clients. If you have any doubts about the font configuration in your account, please reach out to\nsupport@getshaman.com\n.\nButtons populated with an incomplete URL or Veeva token (outlook.com)\nAnother situation we have noticed when using Outlook.com is that when a button is populated with an incomplete URL, or with a token which is being tested in Shaman (not from Veeva CRM), the button disappears, and only the token is displayed (or in the case of an incomplete URL, nothing at all).\nWhen testing the email, the Veeva or Marketing Cloud tokens will not be recognised as a valid URL, and may cause rendering issues. When the Email is sent out from Veeva CRM or Salesforce Marketing Cloud, the tokens are replaced by valid link URL's and the button should render correctly. We always recommend final testing in a sandbox environment before making email content available in production.\nVeeva token (for Veeva hosted document in this case) in Shaman:\nOutlook.com preview:\nApple mail preview:\nIncomplete URL in Shaman:\nOutlook.com preview:\nAnimated GIFs\nSome Outlook desktop clients do not support\nanimated GIFs\n. Outlook 2016 and Outlook 2019\ndo\nsupport GIFs now, but other versions do not. So, check your version of Outlook, first!\nWorking with padding and images\nOutlook removes any padding to images when they are added to the column rather than the container padding of the image itself.\nLet\u00b4s take a look at this example, where we have three equally sized columns, containing an equally sized image in a row, with 10 px padding added to each column:\nThis is how the images render in:\nApple mail preview:\nGmail preview:\nOutlook preview:\nWe can see that not only are the images rendering without the added padded (see how they are wider than the grey text above in the Outlook preview), but also the top of the images are being cropped:\nRecommendation/ solution:\nAdd the padding to the \"General\" - \"Container Padding\" which appears when selecting the image itself:\nTo resolve the top part of the image being cropped, reduce the size of the image slightly:\nOutlook preview after changes are made:\nIt is incredibly important to ensure every person receiving your email will receive the content as you designed it, but you may be surprised to know that according to a Litmus analytics report from October 2024\nhttps://www.litmus.com/email-client-market-share\n, 4.18% of people view their email content using Outlook.\nIf you have any other examples or thoughts about creating email content for Outlook, please get in touch with us\nsupport@getshaman.com\n.",

Here, you can update the \u201cGeneral\u201d information specified when the visual components was created (eg. Name, Brand, etc). Take a look at\nthis article\nfor more information.\nOnce you have completed the obligatory fields in the Overview tab, click the \"Design\" tab.

Are types customisable per account?\nTypes and subtypes are customizable per account, and provide like a base canvas (say email banner might be 600x350px or something, suitable for the use)\nWhat is subtype? Is this customisable per account?\nYes! The subtype options available will depend on which type has been selected. You can think of type and subtype as hierarchical, with the \u201ctype\u201d selected deciding which relevant subtypes should be available for selection. For example, if the type \u201cbanner\u201d is selected, the subtypes available will be more specific examples of banners eg. medium rectangle or leaderboard.\nDepending which subtype you select, the corresponding default dimensions for the subtype will appear underneath. These fields are completely editable, so you can continue with the predefined default dimensions, or update them to custom values.\nWhat file formats are accepted?\nBlank canvas: create a visual component \u201cfrom scratch\u201d\nType of files accepted:\n.JPG, .PNG, .HEIC, .TIFF, .SVG, .PDF (single page PDFs)\nImport design: upload a PDF file (with one page or multiple pages) to import into the visual builder\nType of files accepted:\n.PDF - single page and multipage\n.JPG, .PNG, .HEIC, .TIFF, .SVG, .PDF (single page PDFs)\nStart with a template: You can choose to create a visual component from an existing template\nType of files accepted:\n.JPG, .PNG, .HEIC, .TIFF, .SVG, .PDF (single page PDFs)\nWhat is the difference between importing a design and starting from scratch?\nYou can choose the \u201cImport Design\u201d option to upload a PDF and turn it into editable items, or start from scratch. Within the visual builder, you can also upload images, but not use them as a \u201cbase\u201d as per the \u201cImport Design\u201d option.\nWhy is it necessary to add a language to an image?\nIn case the image contains text, for any future translation and duplication needs.\nOnce I have set the dimensions of a visual component, it is not possible to update the component dimensions?\nYes it is!
