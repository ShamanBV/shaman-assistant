When configuring the Veeva Entity Type Builder Config, administrators can define:
The source Entity Type that will serve as the foundation for the label
The specific document type with which this label will be associated
These settings determine how the entity will be presented and categorized within the Shaman interface.
Step 4: Syncing Veeva Entity Type
After completing both the Veeva Entity Type creation and Builder Config setup, proceed with system-wide deployment:
Navigate to the "Veeva Entity Types" tab
Access the actions menu from the navigation interface
Select "Sync Veeva Entity Types to Companies" from the available options
This synchronization process propagates the configured Entity Types and their associated labels across all registered company accounts. Upon completion, these Entity Types will be accessible within the Shaman user interface.

Similarly to brand images, we can share Global design templates (Templates, fragments & insertable blocks) from a Hub management account to all Participant accounts within the same company group. The same policy applies here that once a Design Template has been put to Live status, it will be shared and made available in all participant accounts (Also marked with a “Global” tag)
There is a recurring sync running every 30 minutes that refreshes the Hub and shares any new content put to live from the Management to the Participant account.
NB: Participant accounts can not edit or delete Global Design Templates. They can however make a local duplicate which can be tailored to their needs.

Design system elements
Email Brand Design System in Shaman consists of the following items:
Brand color and fonts
Brand email policies
Brand Image library
Brand Design Templates
For email template
For email fragment
For email blocks
Modular content
Duplicate complete email documents
General concepts
Brand design system is set per account
Brand design system depends on selected brand
If items need to be available for all brands (eg general enterprise brand, no brand)
Brand colors and fonts: brand > customize = false (you will see default colors and fonts)
Design templates: ‘not brand related’
Images: add image to design template that is ‘not brand related’
All brand design system elements can be duplicated between accounts
Brand colors, fonts and policies in superadmin
Modular content relies on Veeva Vault as single source
Using ShamanHub (accounts in account group)
Images and Design templates from management account to child accounts
Duplicate email documents (template and fragment) using ShamanHub
Content considerations
Background images can be a nice way to make an email pop, but it's important to make sure it is set up in the best way possible to ensure good results throughout.
Background images are supported in most email clients, with the exception of Windows 11 Mail and Office 365 browser versions. This is according to tests carried out internally, 25/9.

1.2 Content Authoring Solution in the Content Value Chain
The life sciences content value chain typically involves multiple stages supported by
different platforms (orange: VVPM, green: Shaman):
Shaman focuses on automating and augmenting the content creation and production
stages — some of the most manual and time-consuming parts of the chain.
Key benefits/ Why Content Authoring matters
Shaman’s authoring capabilities are designed to address several content
challenges across global and local teams:
✅
Accelerate timelines: Faster creation and MLR readiness
💰
Lower costs: Eliminate repetitive agency work
📏
Improve control: Templates and checks enforce brand, legal, and scientific
consistency
🔄
Drive reuse: Enable global-to-local and local-to-local content reuse
✍
Empower teams: Local markets can safely create and adapt content via
self-service
🌍
Enable personalization at scale: easily make variants, update content or
repurpose to other channels
🔗
Ensure seamless MLR handover: Content reuse, modular content and pre
MLR-checks translate into predictable MLR input
1.3 Veeva Silver Product Partner
Shaman is a Certified Veeva Silver Product Partner, which means our integration is
built on validated API connections, follows Veeva development best practices, and is
supported by up-to-date product documentation and production customer references.

# Feature 119

Feature Name: Feature 119

The VeevaImages feature is a Shared builder capability that enables pharmaceutical marketers and content administrators to seamlessly access and incorporate approved brand and country-specific images directly from their client's Veeva Vault Digital Asset Management system into Shaman content authoring workflows. This integration requires additional configuration setup and allows marketing teams to maintain brand compliance by pulling pre-approved visual assets, product images, and promotional materials that have already gone through the medical, legal, and regulatory review process within Veeva Vault. Content creators and field teams can confidently use these vetted images in their Closed Loop Marketing presentations, Approved Email campaigns, and other promotional materials without concerns about regulatory compliance or brand guideline violations. The feature streamlines the asset management process by eliminating the need to manually download, store, and track approved images separately, while ensuring that only current, compliant visual content is available for use in pharmaceutical marketing communications and sales enablement materials.

Details:
- Feature name in Superadmin: VeevaImages
- Builder: Shared
- Deprecated: No
- Feature Description: Provides access to approved brand/country images from client Veeva Vault (Requires additional configuration)

# MLR Documents | Emails

Path: Admin Space > Approved Email Builder

Overview
MLR reviews are a key practice in pharmaceutical marketing, ensuring that marketing and promotional materials comply with regulatory standards. The MLR process usually begins after the client approves the marketing creative work. A team of legal, medical, and regulatory experts carefully reviews each marketing component, assessing the accuracy of medical information, adherence to legal requirements, and compliance with ethical marketing practices.
Although the MLR process may vary slightly among pharmaceutical companies, the primary goal remains the same.
Key Functions
: In Shaman, you can create an MLR document either by exporting the current design directly to the vault from ShamanGo or by uploading a PDF. Additionally, you can retrieve MLR documents from PromoMats and attach them to the email during the Export step.

# How to setup brands for DesignHuddle

Path: Admin Space > Design Huddle

If a Shaman account has the Slide Builder, Visual Builder or ModCon Builder enabled, we need to connect the brands in the Shaman account to a brand in Designhuddle.
If you do not setup a Designhuddle brandID, the brand will not show up in the UI picklist when user wants to create a Slide Project or Visual Component.
Also make sure to set-up Designhuddle credentials in the account to enable authentication.
Background
For the time being (expected to change end 2024) we will manage brand design system from the Design Huddle platform, including colors and fonts. Image library is expected to be moved around Oct. Especially fonts is important: if the font is not installed, the user will not be able to make edits using the original font (Import from PDF, as PDF files do not include fonts).

The user uploads a PDF, which is then covered in DesignHuddle to a Project. DesignHuddle will check if the font is already installed (matched on exact same name). If not, it will show an alert ‘Fix fonts’.
Fix fonts actions
User clicks the button which will open the unmapped fonts found. User can then:
Select correct or other font from list
Upload new font
All new fonts installed while using this brand will be stored in brand level and can be reused for other Projects with the same brand.
How do we deal with fonts?
We expect the majority of projects on between 2- 5 brands per account. In total we estimate 5-15 brands per customer.

ntent Review and Approval
Once content is created in Veeva Vault as material, content owners can initiate and
manage the Medical, Legal, and Regulatory (MLR) review process in VVPM as usual.
Page 5/22

2.3 Content Publishing
Upon MLR approval in VVPM, Shaman can auto-generate final HTML output ready for
publishing.
Publishing workflow depends on content type:
● For Detail Aids (CLM) and Approved Email: Users auto-generate HTML content in
Shaman and sync it into Veeva Vault PromoMats as Email Templates, Email
Fragments, Template Fragments, or Multichannel Presentation with
Multichannel Slides. Metadata can be configured directly in Shaman or inherited
from the source Material document. Depending on your SOP, documents can be
automatically linked (e.g., to approved reference documents) during the sync
process.
● For other content channels/ platforms (eg marketing email, web): Users
auto-generate HTML content in Shaman to download for other platforms.
NB 1: Content is locked from export until it reaches the appropriate approved state in Vault. This
ensures regulatory alignment and reduces the risk of premature distribution.
NB 2: Shaman is not a publishing platform.
2.4 Document Lifecycle Tracking and Permissions
Once synced to Vault, content in Shaman is linked to the Veeva Document ID. This
enables Shaman to:
● Track the document’s lifecycle state in real time
● Control what actions users can perform based on lifecycle stage (e.g., restrict
editing of content in review, restrict export of non approved content)
● Support version-specific logic for editability, exportability, and compliance
checks
This tight integration ensures that content remains consistent across systems, aligns
with your SOPs, and respects Vault governance protocols — while unlocking a more
efficient and user-friendly content creation process.

The SlideBuilderTemplates feature (now deprecated) enabled content administrators and marketing teams to create reusable slide templates directly within Shaman's Slide Builder interface for Veeva Closed Loop Marketing (CLM) presentations. This functionality allowed pharma marketing teams to establish standardized template designs that could be consistently applied across multiple presentation slides, ensuring brand compliance and visual consistency in sales materials. Content creators and digital asset managers would typically use this feature to build template libraries that field representatives could then leverage when customizing presentations for different healthcare provider audiences or therapeutic areas. The feature integrated with Veeva Vault PromoMats for content approval workflows and supported the creation of branded slide layouts, placeholder content structures, and standardized design elements that could be deployed across various CLM presentations and marketing materials within the Veeva commercial ecosystem.

1. Why Shaman Content Authoring
1.1 Introduction and the Shaman Approach
Shaman is your partner on the journey to content excellence. In today’s life sciences
landscape, content is a critical enabler — powering commercial success across field
teams and omnichannel marketing. Next it fuels sales force effectiveness,
segmentation strategies, and next-best action recommendations. All these depend on
producing the right content, at the right time.
Veeva Vault PromoMats plays a central role in this content ecosystem, acting as the
system of record for compliant content management. Shaman complements this by
addressing a major upstream challenge: how content is created. As a self-service
content authoring platform, Shaman provides a scalable, structured, and predictable
way to allow local brand teams to generate high-quality content, ready for MLR review.
By integrating seamlessly with Veeva Vault, Shaman Content Authoring:
● Empowers content creators to work faster and more autonomously
● Significantly reduces content production costs and timelines
● Enables greater reuse and consistency of messaging across brands, markets,
and channels
● Drives adoption by embedding into existing governance frameworks (SOPs,
permissions, lifecycles)
While Shaman is a SaaS platform, our approach goes beyond technology — it combines
software, services, and consultancy. We invest heavily in onboarding and adoption,
working closely with your teams to align our platform with your organizational needs
and regulatory requirements.

The VisualBanner feature in Shaman's Visual Builder enables pharmaceutical marketing teams and content creators to develop custom HTML banner components for their Veeva Closed Loop Marketing (CLM) presentations and promotional materials. This paid system feature allows users to create visually engaging banner elements that can be embedded within Veeva CRM presentations, helping pharmaceutical sales representatives deliver more compelling product messaging during healthcare provider interactions. Marketing teams typically use VisualBanner to design branded headers, promotional callouts, and interactive visual elements that enhance the overall presentation experience while maintaining compliance with pharmaceutical regulations. The feature integrates seamlessly with Shaman's content authoring workflow, allowing created visual components to be deployed directly to Veeva systems for field team access. Content managers and digital marketing specialists often leverage this functionality when building comprehensive CLM slide decks, email templates, or other promotional content that requires custom visual branding beyond standard text and image layouts.

Customization
: Describe any customization options available.
Slide Builder operates independently of Veeva Vault Labels, eliminating the need for modifications to existing label structures. This is due to the following workflow:
Slide Creation: Slides generated using Slide Builder are exported to the internal Shaman system.
Availability: These slides are accessible exclusively during the creation of CLM Presentations.
Export Limitations: It's important to note that these slides are not exported to the client's Veeva Vault Promo Mats (VVPM). Only as part of CLM Presentation these slides are exported to VVPM as Multichannel Slides.
Primary configurations are established during slide creation and within the General Panel of the Overview tab.
Please be advised that slides created for a particular brand are exclusively available for use in CLM Presentations associated with the same brand
Companies have the capability to establish brand-specific typography and color palettes for use within DesignHuddle's Slide Builder.

Title: Shaman Context: 1. What Shaman Is (Core Definition)

## 1. What Shaman Is (Core Definition)

Shaman is a content authoring platform for the pharmaceutical industry, designed to create, localize, manage, and update approved multichannel marketing and medical content.

Shaman is a **guided self-service authoring platform** for end users such as brand marketers and digital managers, instead of agency designers and developers. This makes local pharma teams more agile, flexible, faster and it saves budget.

### What does guided self-service mean?

- **Author content** in a self-service capability
- **Offer a structured, simplified process** for authoring between reusable components and Veeva PromoMats for review and approval that is easy for end users to understand
- **Automates and simplifies steps** by integrating with Veeva, respecting MLR status from Veeva in Shaman

**Guided** means we add additional guardrails for content authoring:

| Phase | Guardrails |
|-------|------------|
| Pre-authoring | Provide design templates, possibly with locked elements |
| Authoring | Respect brand design system, limit brand colors, fonts, images, styling of buttons etc, add content cards, manage references |
| Post-authoring | Shaman compliance assistants check Quality of content, Language and compare against previous approved content (MLR compare) |

Key capabilities:
- Reuse approved components across channels
- Maintain traceability between content, references, and approvals
- Export content compliantly to execution systems (Veeva CRM, SFMC, web, etc.)

### Veeva Vault PromoMats Integration

Shaman is deeply integrated with Veeva Vault PromoMats for:
- MLR (Medical, Legal, Regulatory) review and approval
- Version alignment between authoring and approved assets
- Export of approved content for downstream activation
- Import of Components (images), Claims, references and modular content during authoring

Background & Problem (The "Why")
Our target users (Brand Managers in Pharma) face significant challenges with brand compliance and the rigorous Medical, Legal, and Regulatory (MLR) review process. A primary source of MLR rejections is inconsistent or non-compliant visual styling in marketing emails—such as incorrect font sizes for disclaimers, unapproved colors, or off-brand button styles.
These rejections are costly, slow down the time-to-market for critical sales and marketing content, and create friction for Content Creators who are just trying to do their jobs.

🚫 High Risk of Human Error & Non-Compliance:
The system minimizes the risk of human error by allowing product admins to
lock specific element properties
. This ensures users can only utilize styles that meet strict brand and legal standards, which is vital for pharma compliance.
🎨 Limited Style Options (Controlled Variety):
It enables the creation of multiple brand-compliant style options for the same element (e.g., a "Primary Button" and a "Secondary Button"), enriching the content creator's ability to produce compliant, yet tailored, content.

Existing CLM content can be converted into Smart Content Cards using MagicExtract. Cards can be exported to Veeva Vault PromoMats as MLR Material for review and approval, or it can be mapped to Veeva Modular Content for downstream use.
Shaman Compliance Assistants (incl MLR Compare)
Built-in compliance checks that run during content authoring to ensure tactics are proofread, high quality, and MLR-ready. Includes assistants for content quality (e.g. missing unsubscribe, approval number or URLs, token errors), language (grammar, spelling, readability across 35+ languages), and MLR Compare. Issues versus approved content are flagged in real time so authors can resolve them before submission to MLR, reducing rework and review cycles.

can be reused for other Projects with the same brand.
How do we deal with fonts?
We expect the majority of projects on between 2- 5 brands per account. In total we estimate 5-15 brands per customer. Usually brands have 2-3 fonts (and different font weights) defined in a brand book. Its not uncommon however that PDF artwork of this brand contains more, ‘unofficial’ brand fonts.
As part of the onboarding we can make sure we match the fonts of the brand book. Other fonts however, need to be uploaded or delivered for us to upload by the customer.
We need to maintain a repository of all fonts we maintain, incl weights, brands, end date of contract and vendor of the font (Google font, Adobe font, Myfont).
Instructions
To set-up DesignHuddle brands please follow these steps:
Step1
Make sure you have all relevant information at hand
accountID
Account group name
Brand name
VVPM Id for Brand (if not added in Shaman account)
Name of fonts + weights (if not added in DEH yet)
Font files (if not installed yet)
from customer
internal (Google font, Adobe font, Myfont)
I think we need a workflow here to: check font base/ check if customer can supply/ check if part of onboarding / request to buy fonts (Maurice, Maksim).
Step2
Login Designhuddle and check if brand exists
Go to
shaman.designhuddle.com
:
Go to Admin (top menu) > Accounts (side menu)
Check if the account (same name as
Account Group Name
of the related Shaman Account) already has been setup:

brand button styles.
These rejections are costly, slow down the time-to-market for critical sales and marketing content, and create friction for Content Creators who are just trying to do their jobs. Creators lack a simple, "guardrailed" way to build content, forcing them to manually reference brand guides and increasing the likelihood of human error.
Objective
This feature enables a "Style Guide" within our Unlayer email builder.
Objective:
To guarantee brand and legal compliance in all email content by programmatically enforcing pre-approved styles (fonts, colors, buttons, etc.).
Hypothesis:
By locking down styles and providing creators with a pre-approved list of options, we will:
Drastically reduce the number of MLR rejections related to visual styling.
Increase the speed and efficiency of content creation.
Improve Brand Manager confidence in the content being produced.
Success metrics

When the images are uploaded to a Management account in Hub, we can share them with all participant accounts in the same account group, by setting the status to Live. Any images in Live status will be available in the library for all participant accounts, shown together with a Global tag to help users distinguish the global content from what they have added to the library themselves.
NB: Participant accounts can not edit, delete, or rename global images.
Brand Design Templates
Similarly to brand images, we can share Global design templates (Templates, fragments & insertable blocks) from a Hub management account to all Participant accounts within the same company group. The same policy applies here that once a Design Template has been put to Live status, it will be shared and made available in all participant accounts (Also marked with a “Global” tag)
There is a recurring sync running every 30 minutes that refreshes the Hub and shares any new content put to live from the Management to the Participant account.
NB: Participant accounts can not edit or delete Global Design Templates. They can however make a local duplicate which can be tailored to their needs.
Modular content

Once an account has been connected to the Hub and the Hub itself has been enabled, users can both share and localise materials using the Hub.

Summary
Configuration
User guide
Shaman Connect Introduction
Summary
Prepare your sales call ahead of time by creating a one-off selection of slides and/or Brand Stories that can be presented during the meeting. Shaman Connect Prepare allows the field teams to prepare meetings in advance on an account level.
By opening the presentation with an account selected, you can create a unique selection ahead of your next call. Once prepared, the Connect Menu will provide the opportunity to present your selection the next time you open the presentation with the same account selected.
Configuration
The Prepare feature can be toggled on in the Shaman Menu settings before syncing the presentation to Veeva. If it is used in combination with the Brand Stories feature, the user will be able to choose between Brand Stories, slides, or a mix of both when preparing for the meeting.
User guide
In order to prepare for a meeting, the presenter must first open the presentation and select an account. Once this has been done, the Connect menu can be opened, and the Prepare tab can be found under the Profile section.
​
NB:
The Profile section is retracted by default, and must be opened before the Prepare tab can be accessed.
Once in the tab, select the slides and/or Brand Stories to be presented, and click 'Add x items' to save the selection.
​
Once the selection has been prepared, the presenter will see an overview of the slides/stories that have been selected. Here it is possible to make changes such as adding more content, removing slides or stories, and changing the order.
Once happy with the prepared selection, the presenter can close the menu and end the presentation. The next time the presentation is opened with the same account selected, the user will be provided the opportunity to present the prepared slides.
When clicking 'present prepared slides' the presentation will start immediately on the first slide, and the presenter can swipe through the selection or navigate by opening the progress bar and selecting a slide from the swimlane.
