============================================================

Based on my analysis of these Slack messages from the #product-questions channel, here are the key findings:

## 1. Questions Asked

**Technical Integration Issues:**
- PDF text conversion problems in slide builder (Maryia)
- Export to Vault process getting stuck in step 1 (Laurent)
- MLR relationships disappearing after syncing email templates (Katy - asked twice)
- Veeva user role assignment errors (Katy)
- Login/authentication issues for demos (Xavier)

**Configuration & Setup:**
- How to set up Veeva entities for different subtypes (Katy)
- Default values in Veeva fields setup (Katy)
- Field ordering in slide details pages (Maryia)
- MLR filtering by Therapeutic Area (Maryia)
- VaultUploadNewVersion feature configuration (Katy)

**API & Data Access:**
- GraphQL user query not working (Katy)
- User activity tracking and last login data (Xavier, Katy)

## 2. Common Themes

**Most frequent topics:**
- **Veeva integration challenges** (5+ messages) - configuration, syncing, field setup
- **User management and analytics** (3 messages) - login tracking, user lists, activity monitoring
- **Technical bugs and system issues** (4 messages) - PDF conversion, export processes, preview failures

## 3. Feature Requests

**Specific Enhancement Requests:**
- **Character limit alerts** for Shamango emails (Sophie) - to prevent truncation issues
- **MLR filtering by Therapeutic Area** when fetching from Vault (Maryia)
- **Slide names in heatmap overview** for CLM analytics (Xavier)
- **Custom field filtering** for Vault images (Laurent) - "Is Sensitive Content" filter
- **Support for non-standard Veeva relationships** (Katy) - supporting_document__c vs supporting_documents__vs
- **Red boxing project** for US FDA compliance (Xavier)
- **WhatsApp Business creative resizing** (1080x2160 pixels) for Takeda India

## 4. Pain Points

**Critical Blockers:**
- **Demo access issues** - superadmin problems preventing client demos
- **Litmus preview failures** - credits deducted but no previews generated
- **MLR relationships disappearing** during sync cycles (Shionogi-specific)

**Workflow Frustrations:**
- **PDF text becomes images** in slide builder despite being selectable text
- **Export processes hanging** requiring browser refresh
- **Cannot set default values** for Veeva entities in UI
- **Limited filtering options** for MLR documents
- **GraphQL API changes** breaking existing queries

## 5. Actionable Insights

**High Priority (Fix Immediately):**
1. **Investigate Litmus integration failure** - users losing credits without results
2. **Fix Shionogi MLR relationship bug** - critical sync issue affecting client workflow
3. **Resolve GraphQL API breaking changes** - restore user query functionality
4. **Address PDF text-to-image conversion** in slide builder

**Medium Priority (Next Sprint):**
1. **Implement character limit warnings** for email templates (prevents Veeva truncation)
2. **Add user last-login tracking** to analytics dashboard
3. **Enable MLR filtering by Therapeutic Area** for multi-TA accounts
4. **Support custom Veeva relationship types** for Almirall

**Strategic Initiatives:**
1. **Revive FDA red boxing project** - opportunity for US market expansion
2. **WhatsApp Business integration** - emerging channel opportunity
3. **Enhanced CLM analytics** - slide name visibility in heatmaps

**Documentation Needs:**
- Clear guidance on VaultUploadNewVersion configuration
- PDF creation best practices for slide builder compatibility
- Veeva entities setup workflows with examples

The data shows a product team dealing with integration complexity, particularly around Veeva, while users are requesting both bug fixes and feature enhancements that would improve their daily workflows.
